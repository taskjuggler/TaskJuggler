= About {TaskJuggler}[http://www.taskjuggler.org]

TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful, Free and Open Source Software project
management tool. Its new approach to project planning and tracking is more
flexible and superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools.

TaskJuggler is project management software for serious project managers. It
covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the first idea
to the completion of the project. It assists you during project scoping,
resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk management, and communication
management.

TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project time
lines and resource assignments based on the project outline and the
constraints that you have provided. The built-in resource balancer and
consistency checker will offload you from having to worry about irrelevant details
and it will ring the alarm if the project gets out of hand. The flexible
as-many-details-as-necessary approach allows you to plan your project as you
go, making it also ideal for new management strategies such as Extreme
Programming and Agile Project Management.

If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together the
release schedule of your open source project, TaskJuggler is the right
tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts to impress
your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not be right for you. You
can of course create nice looking Gantt charts. But it takes a little more
effort to master its power. If you are up for this, TaskJuggler will
become a companion that you don't want to miss anymore.

TaskJuggler is written in {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/] and should
be easily installable and usable on all popular operating systems. It may
sound surprising at first, but this software does not need a graphical user
interface. A command shell, a plain text editor (no word processor!), and a web
browser is all you need for your work.
