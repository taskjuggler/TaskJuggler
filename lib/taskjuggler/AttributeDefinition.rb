  # The AttributeDefinition describes the meta information of a PropertyTreeNode
  # attribute. It contains various information about the attribute. Based on
  # these bits of information, the PropertySet objects generate the attribute
  # lists for each PropertyTreeNode upon creation of the node.
  class AttributeDefinition
    attr_reader :id, :name, :objClass, :inheritedFromParent,
                :inheritedFromProject, :scenarioSpecific, :userDefined, :default

    # Create a new AttributeDefinition. _id_ is the ID of the attribute. It must
    # be unique within the PropertySet where it is used. _name_ is a more
    # descriptive text that will be used in report columns and the like.
    # _objClass_ is a reference to the class (not the object itself) of the
    # attribute. The possible classes all have names ending in Attribute.
    # _inheritedFromParent_ is a boolean flag that needs to be true if the
    # node can inherit the setting from the attribute of the parent node.
    # _inheritedFromProject_ is a boolen flag that needs to be true if the
    # node can inherit the setting from an attribute in the global scope.
    # _scenarioSpecific_ is a boolean flag that is set to true if the attribute
    # can have different values for each scenario. _default_ is the default
    # value that is set upon creation of the attribute.
