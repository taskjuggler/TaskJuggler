  # The GanttRouter is used by the GanttChart to route the dependency lines from
  # the start to the end point. The chart is a rectangular area with a certain
  # width and height. The graphical elements of the Gantt chart can be
  # registered as don't-cross-zones. These zones block the either horizontal or
  # vertical lines (or both) from crossing the zone. Zones can be registered by
  # calling addZone(). The route() method returns routed path from
  # start to end point.
