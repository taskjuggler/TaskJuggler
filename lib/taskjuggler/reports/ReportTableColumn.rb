class TaskJuggler

  # The ReportTableColumn class models the output format independend column of a
  # ReportTable. It usually just contains the table header description. The
  # table header comprises of one or two lines per column. So each column header
  # consists of 2 cells. @cell1 is the top cell and must be present. @cell2 is
  # the optional bottom cell. If @cell2 is hidden, @cell1 takes all the vertical
  # space.
  #
  # For some columns, the table does not contain the usual grid lines but
  # another abstract object that responds to the usual generator methods such as
  # to_html(). In such a case, @cell1 references the embedded object via its
  # special variable. The embedded object then replaced the complete column
  # content.

    # header.
