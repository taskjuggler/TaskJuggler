class TaskJuggler

  # This class is the abstract base class for all RichText function handlers.
  # A function handler is responsible for a certain function such as 'example'
  # or 'query'. functions are used in internal RichText references such as
  # '[[example:Allocation 2]]'. 'example' is the function, 'Allocation' is the
  # path and '2' is the first argument. Arguments are optional. The function
  # handler can turn such internal references into Strings or XMLElement
  # trees. Therefor, each derived handler needs to implement a to_s, to_html
  # and to_tagged method that takes two parameter. The first is the path, the
  # second is the argument Array.
