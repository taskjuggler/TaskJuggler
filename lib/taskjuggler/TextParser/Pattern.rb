class TaskJuggler::TextParser

  # This class models the most crutial elements of a syntax description - the
  # pattern. A TextParserPattern primarily consists of a set of tokens. Tokens
  # are Strings where the first character determines the type of the token.
  # There are 4 known types.
  #
  # Terminal token: In the syntax declaration the terminal token is prefixed
  # by an underscore. Terminal tokens are terminal symbols of the syntax tree.
  # They just represent themselves.
  #
  # Variable token: The variable token describes values of a certain class such
  # as strings or numbers. In the syntax declaration the token is prefixed by
  # a dollar sign and the text of the token specifies the variable type. See
  # ProjectFileParser for a complete list of variable types.
  #
  # Reference token: The reference token specifies a reference to another parser
  # rule. In the syntax declaration the token is prefixed by a bang and the
  # text matches the name of the rule. See TextParserRule for details.
  #
  # End token: The . token marks the expected end of the input stream.
  #
  # In addition to the pure syntax tree information the pattern also holds
  # documentary information about the pattern.
