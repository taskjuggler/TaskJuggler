The deadline for your time sheet submission has passed but we haven't received
it yet. Please submit your time sheet immediately so the content can still be
included in the management reports. Please send a copy of your submission
notification email to your manager. If possible, your manager will still try
to include your report data in his/her report.

Please be aware that post deadline submissions must be processed manually and
create an additional load for your manager and/or project manager.  Please try
to submit in time in the future.

Thanks for your cooperation!
