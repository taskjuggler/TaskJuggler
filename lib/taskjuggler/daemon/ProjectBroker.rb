  # The ProjectBroker is the central object of the TaskJuggler daemon. It can
  # manage multiple scheduled projects that it keeps in separate sub
  # processes. Requests to a specific project will be redirected to the
  # specific ProjectServer process. Projects can be added or removed. Adding
  # an already existing one (identified by project ID) will replace the old
  # one as soon as the new one has been scheduled successfully.
  #
  # The daemon uses DRb to communicate with the client and it's sub processes.
  # The communication is restricted to localhost. All remote commands require
  # an authentication key.
  #
  # Currently only tj3client can be used to communicate with the TaskJuggler
  # daemon.
