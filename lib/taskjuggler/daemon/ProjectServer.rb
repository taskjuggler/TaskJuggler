  # The ProjectServer objects are created from the ProjectBroker to handle the
  # data of a particular project. Each ProjectServer runs in a separate
  # process that is forked-off in the constructor. Any action such as adding
  # more files or generating a report will cause the process to fork again,
  # creating a ReportServer object. This way the initially loaded project can
  # be modified but the original version is always preserved for subsequent
  # calls. Each ProjectServer process has a unique secret authentication key
  # that only the ProjectBroker knows. It will pass it with the URI of the
  # ProjectServer to the client to permit direct access to the ProjectServer.
