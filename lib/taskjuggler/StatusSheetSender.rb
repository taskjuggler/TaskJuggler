Please find enclosed your weekly status report template. Please fill out the
form and send it back to the sender of this email. You can either use the
attached file or the body of the email. In case you send it in the body of the
email, make sure it only contains the 'statussheet' syntax. It must be plain
text, UTF-8 encoded and the status sheet header from 'statussheet' to the period
end date must be in a single line that starts at the beginning of the line.
