== Day To Day Juggling ==

=== Working with multiple scenarios ===

To analyze the impact that a small variation can have on a project,
TaskJuggler supports an unlimited amount of scenarios. Each
additional scenario is a slight derivation of the it's parent. The
task tree structure needs to be the same for all scenarios, but most
attributes can vary from one scenario to another. Several report
types support comparative listing of multiple [[scenarios]].

By default, TaskJuggler knows about one scenario, called
''''plan''''. The name of this scenario can be changed just like you
can add more scenarios in the [[project]] section of your project
files.

<[example file="Scenario" tag="header"]>

This header section defines 3 different scenarios. ''''plan'''' is
the top-level scenario. It has two derived scenarios, ''''actual''''
and ''''test''''. These two scenarios are identical to the
''''plan'''' scenario except for those attributes that are changed
for these scenarios. Normally, all scenarios are scheduled on each
''''tj3'''' run. To temporarily disable the scheduling of a scenario,
you can set the [[active]] attribute to ''''no''''.

<[example file="Scenario" tag="task"]>

If you prefix an attribute with the scenario ID followed immediately
by a colon, you can specify a value for a particular attribute. Keep
in mind that setting an attribute also sets the same value for ''all
derived scenarios'' of this scenario as well! If you would specify
''''actual:start'''' first and then ''''plan:start'''', the latter
would overwrite the first value again since actual is a derived
scenario of plan.

The syntax reference lists for each attribute whether it is scenario
specific or not.

=== Important and fall-back Tasks ===

By default, the scheduler tries to guess the right priority of tasks.
The higher the priority, the more likely it will get the requested
resources. To override this mechanism, the [[priority]] attribute can
be used.

<[example file="Priority" tag="project"]>

In the above example, the regular project work needs to be frequently 
interrupted by the ''Customer Support'' task. It's only 2 hours a
day, but it's pretty important that this is done. Since the task has
a higher priority than the regular work, the scheduler will try to
ensure that a maximum of 2 hours per day is spent on support. There
is no guarantee, that the task will always get the resource for 2
hours each day, but it's pretty likely in this setup.

There is only one task that is more important, the ''Attend
Conference'' task. It has fixed dates and we want to make sure
''Tux'' can attend. So we use ''''priority 1000'''', the highest possible
priority. There should be only one such task. If not, you need to
ensure that the top priority tasks don't compete for the same resource
in the same time frame.

In contrast to the support and conference task, the ''Maintenance
work'' task is a fall-back task. It has a lower priority than the
regular work. Tux only gets assigned to it when there is no other
work. We have limited the regular work to 25 hours per week. Since we
spend up to 10 hours per week on support, there should be a remainder
of 5 hours per week for the maintenance task. Again, no guarantees
given.

If you want to ensure that a certain minimum or maximum effort is
spent on a task, you can use the [[warn]] attribute. This will not
affect the decisions of the scheduler, but at least it will trigger a
warning if your criteria are not met.

=== Tracking the Project ===

Once the initial plan has been made and the project has started, TaskJuggler
can be turned from a planning tool into a tracking tool. You don't have to
change a lot to do this. After all, as the initial plan is almost always just a
first guess, you need to continue planning your project as new details become
evident. As the work progresses, you continuously review the state of
the project and update the plan accordingly. A weekly review and
update cycle seems to be pretty common for most projects. Usually the
plan for the past week and the reality are mostly aligned. The future
parts of the project often are more affected by necessary changes.

While it is generally accepted to invest some amount of time in project
planning, it is very common that once the project has been started, project
managers tend to avoid a proper tracking of the project. Our bet is that the
vast majority of project plans are only made to get management or investor
approval. After the approval phase, many project managers only work with their
project plan again when the project is getting out of control and
they are desperate for any help they can get.

Of course, there are projects that are done using strict project
management techniques that require detailed status tracking. Both
extremes probably have their fans and TaskJuggler offers good support
for both extremes as well as various techniques in between.

=== Recording Progress ===

As mentioned previously, your initial project plan is only a first estimate of
how the project will progress. During the course of the project you will have
to make changes to the plan as new information needs to be taken into account
and you probably want to track the progress of the project in a formalized
form. TaskJuggler will support you during this phase of the project as well,
but it needs your help. You have to provide the additional information in the
project file. In return you get current status reports and an updated project
plan based on the current status of the project.

==== Using completion values ====

The most simple form of capturing the current status of the project is to use
the complete attribute.

 task impl "Implementation" {
   depends !spec
   effort 4w
   allocate dev1, dev2
   complete 50
 }

This tells TaskJuggler that 50% of the task's effort has been completed by the
[[now|current date]]. Tasks that have no completion specification will
be assumed to be on track and TaskJuggler calculates the expected
completion degree based on the current date. Completion specifications
only need to be supplied for tasks that are either ahead of schedule
or behind schedule. Please be aware that the completion degree does
not affect the scheduling and resource allocation. It is only for
reporting purposes. It also does not tell TaskJuggler which resource
actually worked on the tasks, nor does it update the total or
remaining effort.

==== Using bookings ====

When TaskJuggler schedules your plan, it can tell you who should work
when on what. Now, that's the plan. But reality might be different.
To tell TaskJuggler what really happened, you can use
[[booking.task|booking statements]]. When the past is exactly
described by providing booking statements, you can enable
[[projection|projection mode]].

Entering all the bookings for each resource and task may sound like a
daunting task at first. If you do it manually, it certainly is.
Fortunately, TaskJuggler can generate them for you by using either
the ''''--freeze'''' option of ''''tj3'''' or by generating a manual
[[export|export report]]. Before we discuss this in more detail, we
need to make sure that the plan is up-to-date.

=== Tracking status and actuals ===

Creating a good project plan is one thing. Executing it is a whole
new story. Usually, the first plan is never fully correct and the
only way to make sure that you are making progress according to plan
is to regularly get status updates from all the project contributors.

These status updates should be provided by all project contributors on
a regular basis, usually once a week. The gathered information should
tell project managers who really worked how much on what tasks and how
much work the contributors believe is really left now. There are two
categories of tasks in a project that need to be treated slightly
differently.

A task can either be effort based or duration based. In the former
case, the contributors must tell how much effort is left. For
duration based task, this doesn't make much sense. For these task,
the expected end date should be reported.

In addition to those numbers, managers in the reporting chain usually
want to have a textual status that describes what happened and what
kind of issues were encountered. Usually, these textual status
reports are combined with alert levels like green, yellow and red.
Green means everything is progressing according to plan, yellow means
there is some schedule risk and red means the project is in serious
trouble. Usually first line managers like to get all the details while
people further up in the reporting chain only like to see summaries
with varying level of details.

All of this creates additional overhead but is usually inevitable to
ensure that you complete the project within the given time and budget.
As a comprehensive project management solution, TaskJuggler provides
full support for all those tracking and reporting steps. It comes with
a powerful email and web based communication system that simplifies
the tracking process for individual contributors as well as managers.

As a side note we would like to mention that the recording of the work
time of employees is regulated by labor law in certain countries. You
might also require approval from a Worker's Council before you can
deploy any time recording tools. Please consult with your corporate
counsel or legal expert for all geographic regions of your teams
before you deploy a time tracking solution.

We also would like to point out that introducing status reporting and
time sheets is usually a big change for every staff. Don't
underestimate the psychological impact and the training requirements.
We also recommend to test the described process with a small group of
employees first to get familiar with the process and to adapt it to
your needs. Don't rush a deployment! You usually only have one chance
to roll-out such a new process.

==== The reporting and tracking cycle ====

In this description, we assume that you are using a weekly reporting
cycle. TaskJuggler does support arbitrary cycles, but we highly
recommend the described weekly cycle.

# '''Time sheets''': Every project contributor needs to fill out a
[[timesheet|time sheet]] once a week. To simplify this task as much
as possible, a template will be send out by email. The template
already lists all tasks that were planned for this week to work on
with the respective effort values and end dates. It also provides
sections for textual status reports. The contributor needs to review
and complete the time sheet and has to send it back via email.
TaskJuggler validates the submission and returns an email with either
an error message or a nicely formatted version of the time sheet.

# All time sheets must be submitted by a certain deadline, e. g.
midnight on Sunday. TaskJuggler will then compile a summary report
and sent it out to a list of interested parties. It will also detect
missing time sheets and will send out a reminder to those
contributors that have not submitted their report.

# On Monday the project managers need to review the time sheets and
update the plan accordingly. TaskJuggler can compile a list changes
compared to the plan. This makes it easy to update the plan according
to the actual progress that was made. The closer the actuals match the
plan the less work this is. The project managers now generate
bookings for the last week and add them to the database with previous
bookings. Doing so, will prevent changes to the plan to affect the
past. Only the future will be modified.

# Once the plan has been updated, managers will receive their status
sheet templates per email. Each manager will get the information for
the tasks that they are [[responsible]] for. To consolidate the
information for the next manager in the reporting chain they can
moderate the reports in three ways. Consolidated manager reports are
called dashboard reports.

## A status report for a task can be removed from the dashboard.

## A status report for a task can be corrected or updated.

## All reports for sub tasks of a task can be summarized by creating
a new status for that task. This will remove all reports for sub
tasks of that particular tasks from the dashboard.

# Managers than need to send back the edited status report via email.
Like with time sheets, TaskJuggler will check them and return either
an error message or a plain text version of the dashboard report of
the manager.

In addition to the plain text versions of the time sheet summaries
and the dashboards, TaskJuggler provides support for publishing them
as HTML pages from a web server.

=== Implementing the status tracking system ===

==== Prerequesites ====

The .tjp and .tji files of your project plan should be managed by a
revision control system. TaskJuggler does not require a particular
software, but for this manual we illustrate the implementation with
[http://subversion.apache.org Subversion]. It should be obvious how
to do this with other software though.

All communication of time sheets and status sheets is done via email.
TaskJuggler has built-in support for sending emails. To receive
emails and to feed them to the correct program, TaskJuggler needs
support from a mail transfer agent (MTA) and a mail processor. In
this documentation we describe the setup with
[http://www.postfix.org/ postfix] as MTA and
[http://www.procmail.org/ procmail] as mail processor. These are
standard parts of any Linux distribution and should be easy to setup.
It's certainly possible to use other MTAs and mail processors, but
this is not the scope of this manual.

Finally, you need a web server to publish your reports. This can
really be any web server. The generated reports are static HTML pages
that can simply be put into a directory that the web server is
serving.

For the email based communication you need to provide email addresses
for all project contributors. This is done in the project plan in the
resource definition by using the [[email]] attribute.

 resource joe "Joe Avergage" {
   email "joe@your_company.com
 }

In this manual, we assume you have a dedicated Linux machine with a
local user called ''''taskjuggler''''. Your project files (*.tjp and
<nowiki>*</nowiki>.tji) is under Subversion control and the
taskjuggler user has a checked-out version in
''''/home/taskjuggler/projects/prj''''. You can use another user name,
another source code management system and even another operating
system like Windows or MacOS. This is all possible, but not the scope
of this manual.

To use the tracking system, you need to setup the
[[Software#tj3d|taskjuggler server]] to serve your project.

==== The Time Sheet Template Sender ====

Each project contributor needs to fill out a time sheet each week. To
simplify the process each contributor will receive a template that
already contains a lot of the information they need to provide.

To send out the time sheets, the command ''''tj3ts_sender'''' must be
used. It will call ''''tj3client'''' with appropriate parameters. To
use it, you need to have a properly configured daemon running and the
appropriate project loaded. Then you need to add the configuration
data for ''''tj3ts_sender'''' to your TaskJuggler configuration file.
The time sheet related settings have their own top-level section:

 _global:
   smtpServer: smtp.your_company.com
   authKey: topsecret
   scmCommand: "svn add %f ; svn commit -m '%m' %f"
   projectId: prj
 _timesheets:
   senderEmail: 'TaskJuggler <timesheets@taskjuggler.your_company.com>'
   _sender:
     hideResource: '~isleaf()'
   _summary:
     sheetRecipients:
       - team@your_company.com
     digestRecipients:
       - managers@your_company.com

The ''''smtpServer'''' defines which host will handle your emails. Replace the
host name with your local SMTP server. The 'scmCommand' setting contains the
command to add and commit new and old files to the source code management
system. The command in this example works for Subversion.

The TaskJuggler server may serve multiple projects. With the
''''projectId'''' option you have to specify which project you would
like to work with. ''''senderEmail'''' is the email address the time
sheet infrastructure will use. Outgoing emails will have this address
as sender so that replies will come back to this email address. We'll
cover later how these are processed.

The hideResource option works similarly to the [[hideresource]]
attribute in the report definitions of the project plan. It allows
you to restrict the sending of time sheet templates to a subset of
your defined resources. In this example, we only want to send
templates to individual resources and not the teams you might have
defined.

By default the time sheets will cover the week from Monday morning
0:00 to Sunday night 24:00. When called without the ''''-e''''
option, ''''tj3ts_sender'''' will send out templates for the current
week.

To call the ''''tj3ts_sender'''' command you either need to be in the
''''/home/taskjuggler/projects/prj'''' directory or use the
''''-c'''' command line option to point it to the configuration file
to use. In the latter case you also need to call it with the
''''-d'''' option to change the output directory to your project
directory.

To test the command without sending out actual emails you can use the
''''--dryrun'''' option on the command line. To do its job,
''''tj3ts_sender'''' needs to generate a number of files and
directories. A copy of the generated templates will be stored in
''''TimeSheetTemplates/<date>/'''' under
''''<resource_id>-date.tji''''. ''''<date>'''' is replaced with the
end date of the reporting interval and ''''<resoruce_id>'''' is the ID
of the resource.

If you re-run the command existing templates will not be regenerated
nor will they be sent out again. You can use the ''''-f''''
command line option to force them to be generated and sent out again.

The ''''tj3ts_sender'''' command will also add the reporting interval
to a file called ''''TimeSheetTemplates/acceptable_invervals''''.
We'll cover this file later on when we deal with the time sheet
receiver.

==== The Time Sheet Receiver ====

To receive the filled-out time sheets and to process them
automatically you need to create a special user. TaskJuggler requires
a number of email addresses to be setup to receive emails. We
recommend to use the following setup. Create a special user called
''''taskjuggler'''' on a dedicated Linux machine. Then create the
following email aliases for this user.

 timesheets
 timesheet-request
 statussheets
 statussheet-request

Your MTA must be configured to use procmail for email delivery. See
the manual of your MTA for details on how to configure aliases and
for using procmail for delivery. If you have a resident MTA expert
you should ask him or her for support.

The next step is to configure procmail to forward the incoming emails
to the appropriate TaskJuggler components. Create a file called
''''.procmailrc'''' in the home directory of the taskjuggler user and
put in the following content:

For debugging and testing purposes, all incoming emails are archived
in a directory called ''''Mail''''. If there is no such directory in
the taskjuggler home directory, you need to create it now.

 PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin            
 MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail/                                    
 DEFAULT=$HOME/Mail/all                                 
 LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/procmail.log                          
 SHELL=/bin/sh                                          
 PROJECTDIR=/home/taskjuggler/projects/prj       
 LANG=en_US.UTF-8                                       
 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

 :0
 /dev/null

This procmail configuration will cause incoming emails that are
addressed to timesheets@taskjuggler.your_company.com to be forwarded
to the ''''tj3ts_receiver'''' program. Of course you need to replace
''your_comany.com'' with whatever domain you are using.

The received emails are then checked for syntactical and logical
errors. If such are found, an email is sent back with an appropriate
error message. The time sheet contains the resource ID of the
reporting resource. As soon as this has been detected, all email
communication will be sent to the email address in the project plan.
Only when the resource ID could not be identified, the sender of the
email will get the answer. This was implemented as a security measure
so other users cannot easily retrieve project related information
from other users.

Correct time sheets are archived in the ''''TimeSheets/<date>/''''
directory where ''''<date>'''' is the end date of the reporting
period. If the directory does not exist yet, it will be created. The
file will be called ''''<resource_id>-<date>.tji''''. If
a SCM command was specified, the file will be automatically put under
revision control. Subsequent submission of the same time sheet will
simply overwrite the earlier submissions. The file name will also be
added to a file called ''''all.tji'''' which consists of include
statements of all time sheet files in the directory. There also is an
automatically maintained file ''''all.tji'''' in the
''''TimeSheets'''' directory that includes all the ''''<date>/all.tji''''
files. To add all the submitted time sheets to your project plan,
simply include the top-level ''''all.tji''''.

''''tj3ts_receiver'''' will only accept time sheets for the time
periods listed in ''''TimeSheetTemplates/acceptable_intervals''''.
''''tj3ts_sender'''' will automatically enable the current period
when it sends out the templates. If you want to stop receiving time
sheet updates for a certain period, simply remove the period from the
''''acceptable_intervals'''' file.

==== Time Sheet Template Requests ====

Normally, the time sheets are sent out once a week automatically. In
case a project contributor leaves earlier for vacation or has lost
the template, they can request the template for the current week
again.

By sending an email to
''''timesheet-request@taskjuggler.your_company.com'''' and putting
their resource ID in the subject of the email, they will receive an
email with the time sheet template. The email will be sent to the
email address in the project plan, not the sender of the request
email.

==== Time Sheet Summaries ====

All time sheets should be successfully submitted by Sunday 24:00.
After this deadline, your can send out a summary of all submitted
time sheets. This summary will also contain a list of those project
contributors that have not submitted their time sheet. These
individuals will also get a reminder to submit their time sheets
immediately.

To send out the summary report, the program ''''tj3ts_summary'''' is
used. Before you can use it, you need to add a few settings to the
TaskJuggler configuration file.

 _global:
   smtpServer: smtp.your_company.com
   authKey: topsecret
   projectId: prj
 _timesheets:
   senderEmail: 'TaskJuggler <timesheets@taskjuggler.your_company.com>'
   _summary:
     sheetRecipients:
       - team@your_company.com
     digestRecipients:
       - managers@your_company.com

''''sheetRecipients'''' is a list of email addresses that should
receive a copy of the submitted time sheet. Each email address must
be put on a separate, properly indented line that starts with a dash
followed by a space. The emails will have the email of the original
time sheet author as sender address.

==== Updating the Project Plan ====

The time sheets contain two kind of information that are intended for
two sets of audiences. Project managers will be interested primarily
in the scheduling related information but surely like to look at the
task status as well.

Managers responsible for certain parts of the project will be
primarily interested in the status reports for the ongoing tasks.
We'll cover the processing of the status information in the next
sections.

This section deals with the processing of the scheduling related
information. Project contributors can specify several deviations of
the current project plan.

* Task may need more effort or time than was originally planned for.

* They may have not worked the planned amounts on the tasks.

* They may have started to work on new tasks that are not even in the
project plan. The is usually a sign of project discipline and should
be avoided. But in reality this will happen and TaskJuggler is able
to handle it.

TaskJuggler can print a summary of all the deltas between the plan
and the actual reports in the time sheets.

 tj3 --warn-ts-deltas YourProject.tjp TimeSheets/all.tji

In this example call ''''YourProject.tjp'''' is your main project
file and all submitted time sheets are included by
TimeSheets/all.tji. This file and all subsequent include files are
automatically generated and updated by ''''tj3ts_receiver''''.

Project managers should use the printed output of this command to
update the project plan accordingly. The specified deltas of existing
tasks must be updated in the main project plan. For new tasks in the
time sheets, the task has to be created in the project plan. Then the
newtask statement in the time sheet needs to be converted into a
normal task report.

  newtask some.task.id "My new task" {
     ...
  }

Needs to be converted into

  task some.task.id {
    ...
  }

The task ID in the status sheet must match the newly created task in
the project plan.

To check that all deltas were properly processed, re-run the check
command.

 tj3 --warn-ts-deltas YourProject.tjp TimeSheets/all.tji

You may also want to remove the interval from the
''''TimeSheetTemplates/acceptable_intervals'''' file to prevent
further submissions of time sheets for this time period.

=== Recording actual Resource Usage ===

To ensure that future changes won't change the past of the project,
we need to freeze the history of the project. History in this context
means which resource worked on what task from when to when. Since
TaskJuggler cannot know what level of detail you want to include in
the reports, this information has to be recorded with the highest
possible accuracy. This means that we have to capture the exact start
and end dates for every period that a resource worked on a task.

Unless you use some external time tracking system to capture this
information and export it to TaskJuggler, you probably want
TaskJuggler to generate this data for you based on the plan
information. 

Before you can freeze that past part of your project, you need to
tell TaskJuggler which scenario should be used for tracking the
actual progress. See the [[trackingscenario]] documentation for more
details on this. Before you freeze your project for the first time,
you should make sure that the current date is still before the
project start. If that is not the case, use the [[now]] attribute to
set the current date to the project start:

 now ${projectstart}

Once you have frozen the project for the first time, you should
remove the [[now]] attribute again. It will be automatically updated.

To freeze your project up to a certain date, you can use the following
command:

  tj3 --freeze yourproject.tjp --freezedate YYYY-MM-DD

This will generate two files, ''''yourproject-header.tji'''' and
''''yourproject-bookings.tji''''. The header files contains the date
of the freeze as a [[now]] attribute. You must [[include.project|
include]] this file at the end of your project header section.

The bookings file contains the resource assignment data. It usually
contains many [[booking.task|booking]] entries that look similar to
this:

  supplement task t {
    booking r 2010-02-19-09:00-+0000 + 3.0h,
            2010-02-19-13:00-+0000 + 5.0h,
            2010-02-22-09:00-+0000 + 3.0h,
            2010-02-22-13:00-+0000 + 5.0h,
  }

The booking file must be [[include.properties|included]] at the end of
your main project file.

In case there are still some discrepancies between the booking data
and the actual assignments of the resources, you can edit the booking
file to correct the data.

The next time you run ''''tj3'''' with your project, all assignments
prior to the date in the project header file will be taken only from
the bookings file. All assignments after this date will be determined
by the scheduler according to your provided constraints.

When you run ''''tj3 --freeze'''' again, it will update the header
and booking files. Since you have included your booking file, any
modifications you have made, will be preserved. That is, the actual
data will be preserved, not the formatting since the file will be
completely re-generated again.

==== Status Sheets ====

For larger projects with many contributors the flood of time sheets
can become hard to manage. Higher level managers are usually not
interested in all the details as long as the project executes
according to plan. To keep the managers on each level informed with
the proper amount and content TaskJuggler provides the concept of
status sheets.

To use status sheets, the reporting chains must be reflected in the
task hierarchy of the project. The [[responsible]] attribute must be
used to assign tasks to managers. Leaf tasks or whole sub trees must
be assigned to the lowest level of management. The responsibility for
one or more level of parent tasks must be assigned to the next level
of managers and so on.

When all time sheets have been submitted, the reports for all tasks
are sent to the responsible managers for these tasks. The information
is generated by the ''''tj3ss_sender'''' program and is called a status
report template. Each manager will get one template that includes the
status reports for the tasks they are responsible for.

It's not the managers task to prepare the report for the next level
of management. To do this, the manager has 3 options:

* Forward the status report of a task directly to the next level. The
original authorship can be keep or removed. The content can also be
edited if needed.

* Similar reports for a task or a whole task sub-tree can be combined
into just one report. To achieve this a new task report must be
created for the parent tasks of these lower-level tasks. This will
replace all reports for sub tasks with this newly created report.

* A task report can simply be removed from the status report.

The status sheet template is designed to perform all three actions in
a simple manner. The original reports are commented out. To remove a
report, it needs to be uncommented and the headline must be set to an
empty string. To change a report, the text must be edited after
the comment marks have been removed. To create a summary report for a
group of tasks, a new report for the common parent task must be
created.

==== The Status Sheet Template Sender ====

To send out the time sheets, the command ''''tj3ts_sender'''' must be
used. It will use the ''''tj3client'''' program to do retrieve the
necessary data from the TaskJuggler server.

Before the program can be used, a new section must be added to the
TaskJuggelr configuration file.

 _statussheets:
   projectId: prj
   _sender:
     senderEmail: 'TaskJuggler <statussheets@taskjuggler.amd.com>'
     hideResource: '~(isleaf()  & manager)'

If you are using status sheets for only one level of management you
can hardcode that like in the example above. For multiple level of
management you need to specify which group of managers should the
report templates be generated for and pass that information on the
command line. Use the ''''--hideresource'''' option to specify a
logicalexpression to filter away the resources you don't want
templates to be generated for. The easiest way to achieve this is by
using unique flags for each management level. In the example above we
assume you have assigned the flag ''''manager'''' to each first-level
manager.

For the override mechanism to work, the manager reports must always
have a newer date than the original report. So, the end date of the
first-level manager status sheets must be after the time sheet
interval. The second-level mangers must use a later date than the
first-level managers and so on.

By default ''''tj3ss_sender'''' will use the next Wednesday as end
date. If you need a different date, you must use the ''''-e''''
option to specify that date.

Let's say you have two levels of managers that use status sheets. The
time sheets are due midnight on Sunday. The project managers can work
in the deltas and new tasks on Monday. After that you generate the
reports for the first level managers with and end date of Wednesday.
This implies a submission deadline of midnight on Tuesday. The second
level manager templates will be sent out right after this deadline
with an end date of Thursday. That would be the deadline for the
second-level managers. The final report can than be generated by
TaskJuggler automatically right after that deadline.

==== Requesting Status Sheet Templates ====

Usually the status sheets templates should be send out automatically.
But sometimes a manager needs them earlier or needs an updated
version due to a late incoming downstream report.

The above provided procmail configuration supports the generation of
status sheets templates on request by email.

By sending an email to statussheet-request@taskjuggler.your_company.com
and putting their resource ID in the subject of the email, managers will
receive an email with the status sheet template. The email will be sent
to the email address in the project plan, not the sender of the
request email.

The setup described here only works for first-level managers. By
adding more email addresses, this can easily be extended for more
levels of management. You just need to make sure that
''''tj3ss_sender'''' is called with the proper parameters to change
the resource selection and end date.

==== The Status Sheet Receiver ====

Similarly to the time sheets a the completed status sheets must be
send back by email. We already described how the necessary email
aliases should be configured. For status sheets the address
''''statussheets@taskjuggler.your_company.com'''' can be used.

The incoming emails will then be forwarded to the
''''tj3ss_receiver'''' program that will process them. To use it, you
first need to add the following settings to the ''''statussheets''''
section of your TaskJuggler configuration file:

 _statussheets:
   projectId: prj
   _receiver:
     senderEmail: 'TaskJuggler <statussheets@taskjuggler.amd.com>'
 
This will set the sender email of outgoing emails. Every incoming
status sheet will be checked and either an error message will be
returned or a consolidated status report for all tasks that the
resource is responsible for. This report can either be directly
forwarded to the next level manager or interested groups, or an HTML
report can be generated and shared. This is especially useful in case
the next level management is not getting status sheet templates.

Usually status reports only contain task reports for the current
reporting period. But if there were tasks with an elevated status,
these will be carried forward until they were removed by providing an
empty headline or replaced with a new report for the same task or a
parent task.
