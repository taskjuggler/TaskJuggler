== The TaskJuggler Software ==

After the installation of a software package the first questions that
most users have is ''"How do I run it?"''. Many users expect to find
an icon on their desktop or an entry in the start menu hierarchy.
Don't bother looking for them, you won't find any for TaskJuggler. As
we have mentioned before, TaskJuggler is a command line program. All
the components are started from a shell by typing in the command name.

This chapter describes the most important TaskJuggler commands and
how to use them. If you haven't used command line programs before,
don't worry - you will quickly get used to it.

=== ''''tj3'''' ===

''''tj3'''' is the main program that you will probably use the
most. It reads in your project files and schedules them. In case
there are no errors, it will also generate all the reports that you
have defined in your project files. It requires at least one
parameter, the name of your main project file. In case your main
project file is called ''''tutorial.tjp'''' you can process it by typing

 tj3 tutorial.tjp

You will see an output similar to the one below.

''''tj3'''' supports a number of runtime options that control the
behavior. Please use the ''''--help'''' option to get more details.

 tj3 --help

=== ''''tj3man'''' ===

''''tj3man'''' provides you with a quick access to the syntax
reference. If you run it without further parameters it will print a
list of all syntax keywords. In some cases, keywords can be used in
different contexts with different meanings. These keywords are listed
multiple times with the context identifier appended separated by a
dot. E. g. the ''''shift'''' keyword can be used in the global
context, in the [[resource]], [[task]] and [[timesheet]] context. It
will be listed as

 shift
 shift.resource
 shift.task
 shift.timesheet

To get more information about a specific keyword you need to provide
it as parameter to ''''tj3man''''.

 tj3man shift.task

The same information that is available in your shell is also available
in your web browser.

 tj3man --html <keyword>

The latter defaults to using the
[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/ Mozilla Firefox] web
browser . Please see

 tj3man --help

how to use a different browser. If you omit the keyword, you will
get this user manual (browser).

=== ''''tj3d'''' ===

''''tj3d'''' is the TaskJuggler daemon. It is a program that runs
in the background, disconnected from your shell to provide certain
services. It can generate reports on demand and processes incoming
time sheets or status reports.

Depending on the size of your project the scheduling time can take
several minutes or more. Since all operations need to be done on the
data of a scheduled project, it makes sense to have this data readily
available. This is the job of the TaskJuggler server or daemon in
Linux lingo. The program is called ''''tj3d''''. When started, it
automatically disconnects from the terminal and runs in the
background. All interactions with the server are done via the TCP/IP
protocol. For security reasons, only connections from the same
machine (localhost) are accepted. To get access all clients must
provide an authentication key. A TaskJuggler server can serve any
number of projects. Once a project has been loaded successfully,
clients can retrieve the data in form of reports. Projects are
identified by their project ID. If a newly added project has the same
ID such as an already loaded project, the new project will replace
the old project once it was scheduled successfully. Before you start
the server, you need to provide a configuration file with some basic
settings.

All taskjuggler components can use the same TaskJuggler configuration
file. The format is a simple plain text format that follows the
[http://www.yaml.org/ YAML specification]. The file should be called
''''.taskjugglerrc'''' or ''''taskjuggler.rc''''. The settings are
structured by sections. Section names always start with an underscore.

 _global:
   authKey: topsecret
   _log:
     logLevel: 3
     outputLevel: 3

This file sets the authentication key for all TaskJuggler components.
You must replace ''topsecret'' with your own random character
sequence.

For the purpose of this documentation we assume you have a local user
called ''taskjuggler'' and your project data in
''''/home/taskjuggler/project/prj''''. Your TaskJuggler configuration
should then be put into
''''/home/taskjuggler/project/prj/.taskjugglerrc''''.

The log section controls the content of the log file. Since the
daemon does not have a terminal attached to it, all messages are
stored in a file called ''''tj3d.log''''. For debugging purposes, you
can use the ''''-d'''' option to prevent the daemon from
disconnecting from the terminal. In this case the ''''outputLevel''''
configuration option controls the amount of details to be printed out.

* 0: No output
* 1: Only fatal errors
* 2: Fatal and normal errors
* 3: Like 2, but additionally with information messages
* 4: Like 3, but additionally with debug messages

The configuration file will be searched in the current directory,
the current user's home directory or ''''/etc''''. You can also
explicitly tell the server where to find the configuration file with
the ''''-c'''' option. See

 tj3d --help

for details.

So far, the daemon has not received any kind of security review. We
strongly advise you to only use the daemon in a trusted environment
with only trusted users!

=== ''''tj3client'''' ===

To control the TaskJuggler server, you need to use the TaskJuggler
client. You can use the client to add or remove projects from the
server, inquire the status of loaded projects. It can also be used to
show the available reports for each project and to generate report or
check time or status sheets.

The client must provide the correct authentication key to the server.
You need to ensure that it can find the proper configuration file
with the authentication key.

 tj3client --help

will provide a full list of supported commands. To load a project
simply type

 tj3client add yourproject.tjp

In case there were no errors

 tj3client status

should now list your project.

 tj3client list-reports <project_id>

shows a list of available reports for the project with the provided
ID. To generate a report, you can type

 tj3client report <project_id> <report_id>

A server that is running can be terminated with the following command.

 tj3client terminate

=== ''''tj3webd'''' ===

This is a web server to serve the HTML reports of a project to any
web browser. The HTML reports are generated on the fly when accessed.
''''tj3webd'''' requires that ''''tj3d'''' is already running on the
same machine.

By default, the web server is listening on port 8080. This can be
changed in the ''''_global'''' section of the config file.

 _global:
   authKey: topsecret
   webServerPort: 8080

To access the HTML reports point your web browser to
''''http://localhost:8080/taskjuggler''''. This assumes that the
server is running on your local machine. You will then see a list of
all loaded projects. Click on the project name to get a list of all
reports for this project.

''WARNING: Please be aware that the web server when you have started
it can be accessed by anybody on your local machine and by anybody
that can reach your machine over the network! It will serve all
reports of all projects that are hosted by the TaskJuggler daemon.''
