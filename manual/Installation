== Installation ==

TaskJuggler III is written in [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby]. It
should run on any platform that Ruby is available on. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution, a package format called
[http://docs.rubygems.org RubyGems].

TaskJuggler III is still under development. There is no stable
version yet. You are welcome to try it. Some users are already using
it successfully for their purposes, but it might not yet be right for
you.

=== Requirements ===

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Please make sure you
have the minimum required version installed.

==== Supported Operating Systems ====

* '''Linux''': Linux is the primary development platform for
TaskJuggler. Releases are tested on recent openSUSE versions.

* '''Other Unix OSes''': Should work as well, but releases are not
tested on these OSes.

* '''Windows''': Windows7 and some older version of Windows should
work. There is no maintainer for this platform, so all releases are
not tested on this platform.

* '''MacOSX''': Will probably work as well. Releases are not tested
on this OS. Older MacOS versions will likely not work.

If you are interested in becoming the maintainer for any of the
currently unmaintained (and untested) OSes, please contact us via the
developer mailing list.

==== Other required Software ====

* '''Ruby:''' TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby.  You need a Ruby
runtime environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ here].  Most Linux
distributions usually have Ruby already included. So does MacOS X
Leopard. For Windows, there is a one-click installer available. The
recommended Ruby version to make full use of TaskJuggler is 1.9.2.
Ruby 1.9.1 contains some bugs that prevent the multi-core support to
work. For users that are not interested in multi-core support, the web
server,  the time sheet infrastructure and daemon Ruby 1.8.7 is still
ok to use. On Windows you need at least Ruby 1.9.2.

See below for instructions on how to use the latest and greates Ruby
version in parallel with your distribution Ruby.

* '''RubyGems:''' If it did not come with your OS or the Ruby
installation, see [http://docs.rubygems.org here] how to get and
install it.

Other versions of Ruby (Rubinius, JRuby, etc.) may work but have not
been tested.

=== Installation Steps for Users ===

==== The easy way ====

TaskJuggler is a commandline tool. It does not (yet) have a graphical
user interface. To use it, you need to know how to open a command
or terminal window. In this manual, we refer to it as your shell. The
following paragraphs describe the commands you need to type into your
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) shell].

On systems that already have Ruby and the gem package manager
installed you can simply type the following command into your shell
or command window:

  gem install taskjuggler

This will download and install the latest version from the
[http://rubygems.org/gems/taskjuggler RubyGems.org] site.

==== The manual way ====

If the easy way doesn't work for you, you need to download and install
the packages manually.  Download TaskJuggler III gem file from the
[http://rubygems.org/gems/taskjuggler RubyGems.org] site.

A gem package is an operating system and architecture independent
archive file for Ruby programs. You can install it on any system that
has Ruby and RubyGems installed.  Normally, you should be logged-in
as root or administrator to run the following installation command.
Replace the X.X.X with the actual version that you have downloaded.

 gem install pkg/taskjuggler-X.X.X.gem 

It will install all components of the Gem in the appropriate place.

On user friendly Linux distributions, the start scripts will be
installed in a standard directory like ''''/usr/bin''''. On Debian
based distributions, the start scripts end up in a place like
''''/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/'''' that is not listed in the ''''PATH''''
variable. You either have to create a symbolic link for each start
script or add the directory to your PATH variable. If you use the
standard [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash bash shell], put the
following line in your ''''${HOME}/.profile'''' file.

 PATH=${PATH}:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/

Windows and MacOS platforms may require similar steps.

=== Update from older TaskJuggler III versions ===

Updates work just like the installation.

 gem update taskjuggler

For downloaded or self-built packages use the following command:

 gem update pkg/taskjuggler-X.X.X.gem


=== Installation Steps for Developers ===

The following description is for users that want to learn more about
TaskJuggler or want to make improvements. TaskJuggler is
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] software and
you are encouraged to read and modify the source code.

To get the source code, the recommended way it to check out the
latest code from the developer repository. To do this, you need to
have [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/ git] installed.

Then checkout the source code with the following command

 git clone http://www.taskjuggler.org/git-repos/taskjuggler3.git

Make sure, you have removed all previously installed instances of
TaskJuggler from your system before doing so. It is a common mistake
to have an old version of the TaskJuggler installed and then use parts
of the old and new version together.

If your Ruby installation does not come with the
[http://rake.rubyforge.org Rake] build tool, you need to install it
now.

If you are interested in a code coverage analysis, you need to also
install the [http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov rcov] code coverage
analysis tool. This tool is not needed for most developers. You can
safely ignore the warning during rake builds if you don't have it
installed.

The following command will create a gem package from the source code.

 cd taskjuggler3; rake gem
 
If you plan to modify the TaskJuggler files, creating and installing
the gem file for every test run is not very comfortable. To run tj3
from source put the following code in ''''${HOME}/bin/tj3''''. 

 #! /usr/bin/ruby
 
 # Set this to your source code directory
 ENV['TASKJUGGLER_DATA_PATH'] = "#{ENV['HOME']}/src/taskjuggler3"
 
 $:.unshift "#{ENV['TASKJUGGLER_DATA_PATH']}/lib/"
 
 require File.basename(__FILE__)

Don't forget to mark it as executable.

 chmod 750 ${HOME}/bin/tj3

Other programs like ''''tj3client'''', ''''tj3man'''' or ''''tj3d'''' can simply be
added as symbolic links to tj3.

  cd ${HOME}/bin
  ln -s tj3 tj3man
  ln -s tj3 tj3client
  ln -s tj3 tj3d

=== Quickly switching between various TaskJuggler III versions ===

One of the benefits of using TaskJuggler from the Git repository is
the ability to get the latest bug fixes. If a bug was reported, it is
usually fixed fairly quickly, but it can take several weeks before
the next official release happens. The following commands must all be
executed from within the checked-out Git directory.

 git pull

gets you the latest changes. We usually try to keep the head branch
stable. Using it should not be much more risky than using a regular
release. Nevertheless, problems can occur and a fixed version might
take a few days.

 git checkout -f XXXXXXXX

will switch your current working copy to the version with commit ID
XXXXXXXX. Alternatively, you can also use tag names.

 git checkout -f release-0.0.10

This will switch to the released version 0.0.10.

 git tag

provides you with a list of all tags.

TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby. There is no make or build process
needed. Every code change is effective immediately. The tutorial, the
manual and some other parts do require a build step.

 rake release

will do it all and even create installable gem files again.

=== Installing a newer Ruby version ===

New Ruby versions are released usually about once or twice a year.
Unfortunately, it takes some time before Linux distributions pick up
the new release. Depending on your distribution, this can take
anything from a few weeks to several years. Many distributions still
have not yet made the switch to Ruby 1.9. The core part of
TaskJuggler can be used with Ruby 1.8.9, but it is at least 3 times
slower. Therefor it is recommended, that you install the latest
stable release of Ruby to use TaskJuggler. This can easily and safely
being done in parallel to your distribution Ruby. Both versions can
be used in parallel without interfering each other.

This section only covers Linux. For other operating system, please
search the web for instructions. If you want to contribute the
description for another OS, please see [[How_To_Contribute]].

First, you need to download the source code of the latest stable
release from
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ www.ruby-lang.org].

The source code is distributed as zipped tarfile. You can extract it
like this. Change the file name to the actual version you have
downloaded.

  tar -Zxvf ruby-X.X.X-*.tar.gz

This will create a directory with the same name as the archive, but
without the ''''.tar.gz'''' extension. Now change into this directory
and configure the source code for your specific OS and compile it.
For this to work, you need to have the GNU C compiler and related
utilities installed. We configure Ruby to append ''''19'''' to all
executable names. This way, you can easily choose if you want to run
the old or the new Ruby. ''''ruby'''' runs your distribution Ruby,
''''ruby19'''' runs your new ruby.

  cd ruby-X.X.X-*
  ./configure --program-suffix=19
  make

If all goes well, you can install it now. This requires root
permission, so you need to enter the root password. All executables
will be installed into ''''/usr/local/bin''''.

  sudo make install

As a final step, you need to install the ''''mail'''' gem.

  sudo gem19 install mail

If you don't want to use TaskJuggler from the git repository, you can
install the TaskJuggler gem as well.

  sudo gem19 install taskjuggler

That's it. You now have the latest Ruby installed and are ready to
use TaskJuggler.

=== Installing the Vim Support ===

TaskJuggler can be used with any text editor that supports UTF-8 text
file editing. If you don't have a preference yet, we recommend to try
the [http://www.vim.org Vim] text editor. It's a very powerful editor
and it has been customized for better integration with TaskJuggler.
This section describes, how to activate and use the Vim integration.
Vim is provided by pretty much any Linux distribution and also works
well on MacOX and Windows. See the web page for how to install it if
you don't have it yet.

This section describes the integration on Linux. Please see the
[[How_To_Contribute]] section if you want to contribute the
description for another OS.

If you have never customized Vim, you need to create a few
directories first.

  cd ${HOME}
  mkdir .vim
  mkdir .vim/syntax

Then copy the syntax file ''''tjp.vim'''' into the vim syntax
directory. The following command works if you have installed
TaskJuggler as a gem with the system provided Ruby. For other cases,
you may have to modify it accordingly.

  cp `gem contents taskjuggler | fgrep tjp.vim` .vim/syntax

Now we have to make sure, Vim detects the file. Edit the
''''.vim/filetype.vim'''' file to contain the following section.

 augroup filetypedetect
 au BufNewFile,BufRead *.tjp,*.tji               setf tjp
 augroup END

And edit the ''''.vim/syntax.vim'''' file to contain the following line.

 au! Syntax tjp          so ~/.vim/syntax/tjp.vim

When you now open a ''''.tjp'''' or ''''.tji'''' file in Vim, you
should have the following features available:

* Syntax highlighting. TJP keywords should be colored in different colors.
* Syntax folding. The optional parts of properties within the curly
  braces can be collapsed. For this to work, the opening brace needs
  to be on the same line as the property keyword. The closing brace
  must be the first non-black character of the last line of the
  block. See the '''':help fold'''' Vim help command for details how
  to open and close folds.
* Tag navigation. If you include a [tagfile] report in your project,
  Vim will know all property IDs and can jump to them. If you have a
  task with the ID ''''foo.bar'''', the command '''':ta foo.bar''''
  will put the cursor right where task ''''foo.bar'''' was declared.
* ID completion. If you include a [tagfile] report in your project,
  Vim can tell you the full hierarchical ID of a property. Just move
  the cursor to the first line of the property definition and press
  ''''Ctrl-]''''.
* Run tj3 from within vim. Just type '''':make your_project.tjp'''' to
  start the scheduling process. In case of errors or warnings, you
  will be able to navigate the errors with '''':cn'''' and
  '''':cp''''.
* Move the cursor over any TaskJuggler syntax keyword and press
  ''''shift-k'''' to get the manual page for this keyword.
