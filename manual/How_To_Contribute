=== How to Contribute ===

==== Why contribute? ====

TaskJuggler is an Open Source Project. It was developed by volunteers
mostly in their spare time. Made available under the GNU General
Public license and similar licenses, TaskJuggler can be shared and
used free of charge by anybody who respects the license conditions.
Does that mean you can use it without worrying about anything? Clearly
not! Though users have no legal obligation to contribute, you should
feel a moral obligation to support Open Source in whatever way you
can. This can range from helping out other users with their first
Linux installation to actively contributing to the TaskJuggler
Project, not just as a programmer. The following section describes,
how you can contribute to any of the components that are part of the
TaskJuggler software releases.  

==== Preparing a contribution ====

All TaskJuggler development is coordinated using the
[https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler/issues github source code
management platform]. All changes must be submitted using Git github
so that we can track the authorship of each submission. There is
[http://help.github.com/ excellent documentation] available on how to
use github. 

Make sure you have followed the steps described in the
[Installation.html#Installation_Steps_for_Developers Installation
Steps for Developers] chapter.

If you have never used Git before, you need to configure it first. You
need to set your name and email address. This information will be
present in all patches that you submit.

 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 git config --global user.email "firstname.lastname@domain.org"

Do not use the development snapshots or send your patches as plain
diff files. We'd like to ensure that we know who contributed to
TaskJuggler. Therefor we are only accepting signed-off git patches
with full user names and valid email addresses.

Next you need to find the files where you want to make your
modifications. Sometimes files will be generated from other files. Do
not change those generated files. Your changes will be overwritten the
next time you call the make utility.

==== Creating a Patch ====

When you are done with your changes, it's a good idea to test them. In
the taskjuggler directory run the following commands. 

 cd taskjuggler3
 rake test
 rake spec
 rake manual
 rake gem

If there are no errors, you can check or test the result. If
everything works fine, you can lock at your changes again.

 git diff

The git-diff utility performs a line-by-line comparison of the files
against the latest version in you local repository. Try to only make
changes that have an impact on the generated files. Do not change
indentation or line wrapping of paragraphs unless absolutely
necessary. These kinds of changes increase the size of diff files and
make it much harder to evaluate the patches. When making changes to
the program code, please use exactly the same coding style as the
rest of the code. If your contribution is large enough to justify a
copyright claim, please indicate what copyright you claim in the
patch. For modifications to existing files, we will assume that your
contribution falls under the same license as the modified file. All
new files will need to contain a license declaration, preferably GPL
version 2. In any case, the license must be
[http://www.opensource.org/licenses an OSI accepted license] and be
compatible with the GPL version 2 used by the rest of the project.

Review all changes carefully. In case you have created new source
files, you need to register them with your repository.

 git add FILENAME

If you think you are done, you can commit your changes to your local
repository.

 git commit -a -s

The -s parameter is very important. We will only accept signed-off patches. By
signing off on your patches you confirm that you wrote the code and have the
right to pass it on as a patch. See
[http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html this
document] for more information!

Please include a meaningful commit message. The first line (header line) should
be prefixed by ''''Fix: '''' for bug fixes or ''''New: '''' for new features.
This is used to automatically generate the change log from one release to
another. So a bug that has been introduced after the last release and is fixed
before the next release does not need to be included in the changelog. For
those cases, don't use any prefix.

After the header line leave a blank line and include one or more paragraphs
with more detailed information about the patch. This information will also be
included in the the change log if the header line has a prefix.

If you fix a bug that was reported by somebody else, please also include a reported-by line:

 Reported-by: whoever-reported-the-bug

Then push it into your forked github repository.

 git push

The final step is to send us a [http://help.github.com/pull-requests/
pull request] for your changes.

==== Contributing to the User Manual ====

The user manual is currently a rough port of the 2.x manual. It
contains many inaccuracies and does not provide much more than a
tutorial and a syntax reference. Any help to turn this into a real
user manual is greatly appreciated.

The manual is composed from 3 different sources.

# The sources for normal pages are in MediaWiki format and can be
found in the ''''manual'''' directory of the source distribution. 

# The information in the syntax reference is extracted from the TJP
parser source code. It can be found in the file
''''lib/TjpSyntaxRules.rb''''. You can ignore all but the
''''doc(...)'''', ''''arg(...)'''' and ''''example(...)'''' sections.

# The TJP examples are in the ''''test/TestSuite/Syntax/Correct''''
directory.

The following commands build the HTML files for the manual in the
''''data/manual'''' directory.

 cd lib
 ruby UserManual.rb 

==== Contributing to the Test Suite ====

The test suite can be found in the ''''test'''' and ''''spec''''
directories. It contains unit and system tests but is very rudimentary
at the moment.  Adding more system tests to the test/CSV-Report directory
is probably the best place to start. Originally, TaskJuggler used
classic Ruby unit tests, but a migration to
[http://rspec.info/|RSpec-2] is in the works now. New tests should be
written as RSpec tests unless they require infrastructure only
available in the ''''test'''' directory.

==== Contributing to the Ruby code ====

For the first stable TaskJuggler release we have most 2.x
features supported. The few things that break backwards compatibility
are documented in the [[TaskJuggler_2x_Migration]] section.

In general, patches are very welcome. Please follow the coding style
and naming conventions used in the existing code. Larger changes
should be preceded by a discussion in the
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/forum.php TaskJuggler Developer Forum].

==== Some final words to Contributors ====

We do welcome all contributions, but please understand that we reserve
the right to reject any contribution that does not follow the above
guidelines or otherwise conflicts with the goals of the TaskJuggler
team. It is a good idea to contact the team prior to making any larger
efforts.
