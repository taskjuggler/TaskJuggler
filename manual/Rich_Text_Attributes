=== Rich Text Attributes ===

TaskJuggler supports Rich Text data for some STRING attributes that
are marked accordingly in the syntax reference. Rich Text means, that
you can use certain markup symbols to structure the text into
sections, include headlines, bullet lists and the like. The following
sections describe the supported markup elements and how to use them.

The markup syntax is mostly compatible to the syntax used by the
popular [http://www.mediawiki.org MediaWiki].

==== Block Markups ====

All block markups are delimited by an empty line. The markup must
always start at the beginning of the first line of the block. Block
markups cannot be nested.

The simplest form of a block is a paragraph. It's a block of text
that is separated by empty lines from other blocks. There is no
markup needed to start a text block.

Headlines can be inserted by using ''''='''' characters to start a
line. There are 3 level of headlines.

 == Headline Level 1 ==
 === Headline Level 2 ===
 ==== Headline Level 3 ====

A line that starts with four dashes creates a horizontal line.

 ----

Items of a bullet list start with a star. The number of stars
determines the bullet list level of the item. Three levels are
supported. Bullet items may span multiple lines but cannot contain
paragraphs.

 * Bullet 1
 ** Bullet 2
 *** Bullet 3

Enumerated lists are formed by using a ''''#'''' instead of ''''*''''.

 # Enumeration Level 1
 ## Enumeration Level 2
 ### Enumeration Level 3

Sections of lines that start with a space character are interpreted
as pre-formatted text. The formatting will be preserved by using a
fixed-width font and by not interpreting any markup characters within
the text.

  Preformatted text start with
  a single space at the start of 
  each line.

==== In-Line Markups ====

In-line markups may occur within a text block. They don't have to
start at the start of the line.

 This is an ''italic'' word.
 This is a '''bold''' word.
 This is a ''''monospaced'''' word.
 This is a '''''italic and bold''''' word.

The monospace format is not part of the original MediaWiki markup, but
we found it useful to have for this manual.

Links to external documents are possible as well. In the first form,
the URL will appear in the readable text as well. In the second form,
the text after the URL will be visible but the link will be available
if the output format supports it.

For local references, the second form is available as well. In this
form, ''''.html'''' is appended to the first word in the reference to
create the URL.

 [[item]]
 [[item|An item]]

Images can be added with a similar syntax.

 [[File:image.jpg]]
 [[File:image.jpg|alt=An image]]

This first version will be replaced with the file ''''image.jpg''''
when the output format supports this. Otherwise a blank space will be
inserted. The second version inserts the text ''''An image'''' if the
output format does not support images. The following image types are
supported and detected by their file name extensions: ''''.jpg'''',
''''.gif'''', ''''.png'''' and ''''.svg''''. 

In some situations, it is desirable to not interpret certain markup
sequences and reproduce the text verbatim. Such text must be enclosed
in nowiki tags.

 <nowiki> This is not '''bold''' text. </nowiki>

==== Block and Inline Generators ====

Block and inline generators are a very powerful extension that allow
you to insert arbitrarily complex content. Block generators create a
text block whereas inline generators generate an element that fits
inside a text paragraph.

Block generators use the following syntax:

 <[generator_name parameter1="value1" ... ]>

Inline generators have a very similar syntax:

 <-generator_name parameter1="value1" ... ->

Each generator is identified by a name. See the following list for
supported generators and their functionality. Generators can have one or
more optional parameters. Some parameters are mandatory, other are
optional. The value of a parameter must be enclosed in single or
double quotes. Since your rich text content must already be enclosed
by double or single quotes, make sure you don't use the same quoting
marks for the parameter value. Alternatively you can put a backslash
in front of the quote mark to escape it.

----
'''Block Generator''' ''''navigator''''

Parameters:

* ''''id'''' : ID of a defined [[navigator]]

The navigator generator inserts the referenced navigator.
----
'''Block Generator''' ''''report''''

Paramters:

* ''''id'''' : ID of a defined [[report]]

The report generator inserts the referenced report as a new block
of this text. The referenced report inherits some context such as the
report period and the property set from the referencing report.
----
'''Inline Generator''' ''''reportlink''''

Paramters:

* ''''id'''' : ID of a defined [[report]]

The report link generator inserts a link to the referenced report.
----
'''Inline Generator''' ''''query''''

Paramters:

* ''''family'''' : Specifies whether a ''''task'''' or a ''''resource''''
should be queried.

* ''''property'''' : The ID of the task or resource to be queried. If no
property is specified, the query will return a global project
attribute.

* ''''scopeproperty'''' : The ID of the scope property. If the property is a
task this must be a resource ID and vice versa.

* ''''attribute'''' : The ID of the attribute which value should be returned
by the query. If a property ID is provided, this must be one of the
names that can be used as [[columnid]] values. Without a property,
global attributes of the project can be requested. The following
attributes are supported: ''''copyright'''', ''''currency'''',
''''end'''', ''''name'''', ''''now'''', ''''projectid'''',
''''start'''' and ''''version''''.

* ''''scenario'''' : The ID of a scenario. This must be provided whenever the
requested attribute is scenario specific.

* ''''start'''' : The start date of the report period of the current report.

* ''''end'''' : The end date of the report period of the current report.

* ''''loadunit'''' : The [[loadunit]] that should be used in case the
requested attribute is an effort or duration value.

* ''''timeformat'''' : The [[timeformat]] used to format date attributes.

* ''''numberformat'''' : The [[numberformat]] used to format arithmetic
attributes.

* ''''currencyformat'''' : The [[currencyformat]] used to format currency
values.

The query generator inserts any requested value from the project, a
task or a resource.

Queries are context aware. Depending on the context where the query
is used, certain or all of the above parameters have already
predefined values. When used in the header section of a report, the
context does not provide a property or scope property. Start and end
dates as well the formatting options are taken from the report
context. But when used e. g. in [[celltext.column]] the cell
provides, that property and the attribute and possibly even the scope
property.
