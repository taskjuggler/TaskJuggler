== The Tutorial: Your first Project ==

We have mentioned already that TaskJuggler uses plain text files that
describe the project to schedule it. As you will see now, the syntax
of these files is easy to understand and very intuitive. This chapter
will walk you step by step through your first project. You create the
project plan for a made-up accounting software project. This project
demonstrates some of the commonly used features of TaskJuggler. The
complete example can be downloaded
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Tutorial/tutorial.tjp here]. The
resulting reports can be found
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Overview.html
here].

=== Starting the project ===

To start a TaskJuggler project file you need to use the [[project]]
property. It tells TaskJuggler the name of your project and a start
and end date. The start and end dates don't need to be exact, but must
fit all tasks of the project.  It is the time interval the TaskJuggler
scheduler will use to fit the tasks in. So, make it large enough for
all your tasks to fit in. But don't make it too large, because this
will result in longer scheduling times and higher memory consumption.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="header1"]>

All TaskJuggler properties have two required attributes, a unique ID
and a name, and a set of optional attributes. The name must always be
specified. The ID can be omitted if you never have to reference the
property from another context. If you omit the ID, TaskJuggler will
automatically generate a unique ID. The other optional attributes are
always enclosed in curly braces. If no optional attributes are
specified, the braces can be omitted as well. In this example we will
introduce a number of there attributes that may or may not matter to
you. If you don't see an immediate need for a specific attribute, feel
free to ignore it for now. You can always come back to them later. A
full list of the supported attributes can be found in the
''attributes'' section of the [[project]] property documentation.

Attributes always start with a keyword that is unique in the context.
A context is delimited by a set of curly braces that enclose optional
attributes of a property. The area between properties is called the
global scope.  Usually, attributes have one or more arguments. These
arguments can be dates, character strings, numbers or symbols. Strings
must be enclosed in single or double quotes. The argument types and
meaning is explained for each keyword in the syntax reference section
of this manual.

TaskJuggler manages all events with an accuracy of up to 15 minutes.
In many cases, you don't care about this level of accuracy.
Nevertheless, it's good to have it when you need it. All dates can
optionally be extended by a time. By default, TaskJuggler assumes
that all times are UTC (world time) times. If you prefer a different
time zone, you need to use the [[timezone]] attribute.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="timezone"]>

Be aware that the project start and end dates in the project header
are specified before you specify the time zone. The project header
dates are always assumed to be UTC unless you specify differently.
See [[interval2]] for details.

 project acso "Accounting Software"  2002-01-16-0:00-+0100

The [[currency]] attribute specifies the unit of currency values.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="currency"]>

Because each culture has its own way of specifying dates and numbers,
the format for these are configurable.  Use the [[timeformat]]
attribute to specify the default format for dates. This format is used
for reports, it does not affect the way you specify dates in the
project files. Here you always need to use the [[date|ISO standardized
notation]].

<[example file="tutorial" tag="formats"]>

We also can specify the way numbers or currency values are shown in
the reports. Use the [[numberformat]] and [[currencyformat]]
attributes for this.

The optional attribute [[now]] is used to set the current day for the
scheduler to another value than to the moment your invoke TaskJuggler.
When this attribute is not present, TaskJuggler will use the current
moment of time to determine where you are with your tasks. To get a
defined result for the reports in this example we've picked a specific
date that fits our purpose here. In your projects, you would use
[[now]] to generate status reports for the date you specify.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="now"]>

In this tutorial we would like to compare two scenarios of the
project. The first scenario is the one that we have planned. The
second scenario is how it really happened. The two scenarios have the
same task structure, but the start and end dates of the task may vary.
In reality we assume that the project got delayed, so we call the
second scenario "Delayed". The scenario property is used to specify
the scenarios. The delayed scenario is nested into the plan scenario.
This tells TaskJuggler to use all values from the plan scenario also
for the second scenario unless the second scenario has it's own
values. This is a very easy but also powerful way to analyze the
impact of certain changes to the plan of record.  We'll see further
below, how to specify values for a scenario and how to compare the
results.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="scenario"]>

To summarize the above, let's look at the complete header again.
Don't get scared by the wealth of attributes here. They are all
optional and mostly used to illustrate the flexibility of TaskJuggler.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="header2"]>

=== Global Attributes ===

For this tutorial, we also like to do a simple profit and loss
analysis of the project. We will track labor cost versus customer
payments. To calculate the labor costs we have to specify the default
daily costs of an employee. This can be changed for certain employees
later, but it illustrates an important concept of TaskJuggler –
inheritance of attributes. In order to reduce the size of the
TaskJuggler project file to a readable minimum, properties inherit
many optional attributes from their enclosing scopes. We'll see
further below, what this actually means. Right after the project
property we are at top-level scope, so this is the default for all
following properties.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="rate"]>

The [[rate]] attribute can be used to specify the daily costs of
resources. All subsequent resources will get this rate. But it can be
changed to a different rate at group or individual resource level.

You may also want to tell TaskJuggler about holidays that affect
all resources. Global vacations are time periods where TaskJuggler
does not do any resource assignments to tasks.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="vacation"]>

Use the [[vacation]] attribute to define a global vacation. Global
vacations must have a name and a date or date range. This is slightly
different from vacations of individual resources. They are defined
with the [[vacation.resource|vacation attribute for resources]] where
the name is optional. The vacation name is purely for documentation
purposes.

=== Macros ===

Macros are another TaskJuggler feature to keep project files small.
Macros are text patterns that can be defined once and inserted
multiple times in the project file. A [[macro]] always has a name and the
text pattern is enclosed by square brackets. 

<[example file="tutorial" tag="macro"]>

To use the macro you simply have to write
''''${allocate_developers}'''' and TaskJuggler will replace the term
''''${allocate_developers}'''' with the pattern. We will use this
macro further below in the example and then explain the meaning of the
pattern.

=== Declaring Flags ===

A TaskJuggler feature that you will probably make heavy use of is
flags. Once declared you can attach them to many properties. When you
generate reports of the TaskJuggler results, you can use the flags to
filter out information and limit the report to exactly those details
that you want to have included.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="flags"]>

This is flag declaration. All [[flags]] need to be declared, before they
can be used to avoid hard to find errors due to misspelled flag
names. The flags should be declared shortly below the project header.
We will see further down, how we can make use of these flags.

=== Declaring Accounts ===

The use of our resources will create costs. For a profit and loss
analysis, we need to balance the costs against the customer payments.
In order not to get lost with all the various amounts, we declare 3
[[account|accounts]] to credit the amounts to. We create one account
for the development costs, one for the documentation costs, and one
for the customer payments.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="accounts"]>

Like all TaskJuggler properties, the account needs an ID and a name.
IDs may only consist of the characters a to z, A to Z and the
underscore. All but the first character may also be digits 0 to 9.
All global TaskJuggler properties have IDs. The ID is necessary so
that we can reference the property again later without having to write
the potentially much longer name. The name may contain space
characters and therefore has to be enclosed with single or double
quotes.

Accounts can be grouped by nesting them. You can use this feature to
create sets of accounts. Such sets can then be balanced against each
other to create a profit and loss analysis. When you have specified
accounts in your project, you must at least define one default
[[balance]].

<[example file="tutorial" tag="balance"]>

=== Declaring Resources ===

While the above introduced account property is only needed if you
want to do a P&L analysis, resources are usually found in almost any
project.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="resources"]>

This snippet of the example shows the use of the [[resource|
resource property]]. Just like accounts, resources always have an ID
and a Name. These IDs also need to be unique within their property
class.  Names are strings and as such enclosed in double quotes. As
you can see, resource properties can be nested: ''''dev'''' is a group
or container resource, a team that consists of three other resources.

''''dev1'''', alias Paul Smith, costs more than the normal employee.
So the declaration of ''''dev1'''' overwrites the inherited default
rate with a higher value.

The default value has been inherited from the enclosing scope,
resource ''''dev'''', which in turn has inherited it from the global
scope.  The declaration of the resource Klaus Müller uses another
optional attribute. With vacation you can specify a certain time
interval where the resource is not available. Vacations are list
attributes. They accumulate the declarations. If you want to get rid
of inherited values, you can use the [[purge]] attribute to clear the
list.

It is important that you understand how TaskJuggler handles time
intervals.  Internally, TaskJuggler uses the number of seconds after
January 1st, 1970 to store any date.  So all dates are actually stored
with an accuracy of 1 second in UTC time. ''''2002-02-01'''' specifies
midnight February 1st, 2002. Following the TaskJuggler concept of
requiring as little information as necessary and extending the rest
with sensible defaults, TaskJuggler adds the time 0:00:00 if nothing
else has been specified. So the vacation ends on midnight February
5th, 2002. Well, almost. Every time you specify a time interval, the
end date is not included in the interval. So Klaus Müller's vacation
ends exactly at 0:00:00 on February 4th, 2002.

Peter Murphy only works 6.4 hours a day. So we use the
[[limits.resource|limits]] attribute to limit his daily working hours.
We could also define exact working hours using the [[shift|shift
property]], but we ignore this for now.

Note that we have attached the flag team after the declaration of the
sub-resources to the team resources.  This way, these flags don't get
passed down to the sub-resources. If we would have declared the flags
before the sub-resources, then they would have the flags attached as
well.

=== Specifying the Tasks ===

Let's focus on the real work now. The project should solve a problem:
the creation of an accounting software. Because the job is quite
complicated, we break it down into several subtasks. We need to do a
specification, develop the software, test the software, and write a
manual. Using the [[task|task property]], thiis would look as follows:

<[example file="tutorial" tag="task1"]>

Similar to resources, tasks are declared by using the task keyword
followed by an ID and a name string. All TaskJuggler properties have
their own namespaces. This means, that it is quite OK to have a
resource and a task with the same ID. Tasks may have optional
attributes which can be tasks again, so tasks can be nested. In
contrast to all other TaskJuggler properties, task IDs inherit the ID
of the enclosing task as a prefix to the ID. The full ID of the spec
task is AcSo.spec. You need to use this absolute ID when you want to
reference the task later on. This hierarchical name space for tasks
was chosen to support large projects where multiple project managers
may use the same ID in different sub tasks.

To track important milestones of the project, we also added a task
called Milestones. This task, like most of the other tasks will get
some subtasks later on.

We consider the specification task simple enough, so we don't have to
break it into further subtasks. So let's add some more details to it.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="spec"]>

The [[effort]] to complete the task is specified with 20 man-days.
Alternatively we could have used the [[length]] attribute or
the [[duration]] attribute. ''''length'''' specifies the
duration of the task in working days while ''''duration'''' specifies
the duration in calendar days.  Contrary to ''''effort'''', these two don't
have to have a specification of the involved resources. Since
''''effort'''' specifies the duration in man-days, we need to say who
should be allocated to the task. The task won't finish before the
resources could be allocated long enough to reach the specified
effort. Tasks with ''''length'''' or ''''duration'''' criteria and
allocated resources will last exactly as long as requested. Resources
will be allocated only if available. It's possible that such a tasks
ends up with no allocations at all since the resources are always
assigned to other tasks for that period. Each task can only have one
of the three duration criteria. Container tasks may never have a
duration specification. They are automatically adjusted to fit all
sub tasks.

Here we use the allocate_developers macro mentioned above. The
expression ''''${allocate_developers}'''' is simply expanded to 

<[example file="tutorial" tag="expandedmacro"]>

If you need to [[allocate]] the same bunch of people to several tasks,
the macro saves you some typing. You could have written the allocate
attributes directly instead of using the macro. Since the allocation
of multiple resources to a task is a very common place for macro
usage, we found it a good idea to use it in this example as well.

One more interesting thing to note is the fact that we like the
resource ''''dev2'''' only to work 4 hours each day on this task, so
we use the optional attribute [[limits.resource]] to specify this.

For TaskJuggler to schedule a task, it needs to know either the start
and end criteria of a task, or one of them and a duration
specification. The start and end criteria can either be fixed dates or
relative dates. Relative dates are specifications of the type ''task B
starts after task A has finished''. Or in other words, task B depends
on task A. In this example the spec task depends on a subtasks of the
deliveries task. We have not specified it yet, but it has the local ID
start.

To specify the dependency between the two tasks, we use the
[[depends]] attribute. This attribute must be followed by one or more
task IDs. If more than one ID is specified, each ID has to be
separated with a comma from the previous one. Task IDs can be either
absolute IDs or relative IDs. An absolute ID of a task is the ID of
this task prepended by the IDs of all enclosing tasks. The task IDs
are separated by a dot from each other. The absolute ID of the
specification task would be ''''AcSo.spec''''.

Relative IDs always start with one or more exclamation marks. Each
exclamation mark moves the scope to the next enclosing task. So
''''!deliveries.start'''' is expanded to ''''AcSo.deliveries.start''''
since ''''AcSo'''' is the enclosing task of deliveries. Relative task
IDs are a little bit confusing at first, but have a real advantage
over absolute IDs.  Sooner or later you want to move tasks around in
your project and then it's a lot less likely that you have to fix
dependency specifications of relative IDs.

The software development task is still too complex to specify it
directly. So we split it further into subtasks.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="software"]>

We use the [[priority]] attribute to mark the importance of
the tasks. 500 is the default priority of top-level tasks. Setting the
priority to 1000 marks the task as most important task, since the
possible range is 1 (not important at all) to 1000 (ultimately
important). priority is an attribute that is passed down to subtasks
if specified before the subtasks' declaration. So all subtasks of
software have a priority of 1000 as well, unless they have their own
priority definition.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="database"]>

The work on the database coupling should not start before the
specification has been finished. So we again use the [[depends]]
attribute to let TaskJuggler know about this. This time we use two
exclamation marks for the relative ID. The first one puts us in the
scope of the enclosing software task. The second one is to get into
the AcSo scope that contains the spec tasks. For a change, we
[[allocate]] resources directly without using a macro.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="gui"]>

TaskJuggler can schedule your project for two different [[scenario|
scenarios]]. We have called the first scenario ''''plan'''' scenario
and the second ''''delayed'''' scenario. Many of the reports allow you
to put the values of both scenarios side by side to each other, so you
can compare the scenarios. All scenario-specific values that are
not explicitly stated for the ''''delayed'''' scenario are taken from
the ''''plan'''' scenario. So the user only has to specify the values
that differ in the delayed scenario.  The two scenarios must have the
same task structure and the same dependencies. But the start and end
dates of tasks as well as the duration may vary. In the example we
have planned the work on the graphical user interface to be 35
man-days. It turned out that we actually needed 40 man-days. By
prefixing the [[effort]] attribute with ''''delayed:'''', the
effort value for the ''''delayed'''' scenario can be specified.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="backend"]>

By default, TaskJuggler assumes that all tasks are on schedule.
Sometimes you want to generate reports that show how much of a task
actually has been completed. TaskJuggler uses the current date for
this, unless you have specified another date using the now attribute.
If a task is ahead of schedule or late, this can be specified using
the [[complete]] attribute. This specifies how many percent
of the task have been completed up to the current date. In our case
the back-end implementation is slightly ahead of schedule as we will
see from the report.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="test"]>

The software testing task has been split up into an alpha and
a beta test task. The interesting thing here is, that efforts can not
only be specified as man-days, but also man-weeks, man-hours, etc. By
default, TaskJuggler assumes a man-day is 8 hours, man-week is 40
man-hours or 5 man-days. The conversion factor can be changed using the
[[dailyworkinghours]] attribute.

Let's go back to the outermost task again. At the beginning of the
example we stated that we want to credit all development work to one
account with ID dev and all documentation work to the account doc. To
achieve this, we use the attribute [[chargeset]] to credit
all tasks to the ''''dev'''' account.

For the duration of the ''''AcSo'''' task we also have running costs
for the lease on the building and the equipment. To compensate this,
we charge a daily rate of USD 170 per day using the [[charge]]
attribute.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="charge"]>

Since we specify the attribute for the top-level task before we
declare any subtasks, this attribute will be inherited by all subtasks
and their subtasks and so on. The only exception is the writing of the
manual. We need to change the chargeset for this task again, as it is
also a subtask of AcSo and we want to use a different account for it.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="manual"]>

=== Specifying Milestones ===

All tasks that have been discussed so far, had a certain duration. We
did not always specify the duration explicitly, but we expect them to
last for a certain period of time. Sometimes you just want to capture
a certain moment in your project plan. These moments are usually
called milestones, since they have some level of importance for the
progress of the project.

TaskJuggler has support for milestones as well. Milestones are leaf
tasks that don't have a duration specification.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="deliveries"]>

We have put all important milestones of the project as subtasks of the
deliveries task. This way they show up nicely grouped in the reports.
All milestones either have a dependency or a fixed start date. For the
first milestone we have used the attribute [[start]] to set a fixed start
date. All other tasks have direct or indirect dependencies on this
task. Moving back the start date will slip the whole project. This has
actually happened, so we use the ''''delayed:'''' prefix again to
specify the start date for the delayed scenario.

Every milestone is linked to a customer payment. By using the
[[charge]] attribute we can credit the specified amount to the
account associated with this task. Since we have assigned the
''''rev'''' account to the enclosing task, all milestones will use
this account as well. This time, we use the keyword ''''onstart''''
to indicate that this is not a continuous charge but a one-time
charge that is credited at the begin of the task.

Did you notice the line in the task done that starts with a hash? This
line is commented out. If TaskJuggler finds a hash, it ignores the
rest of the line. This way you can include comments in your project.
The [[maxend]] attribute specifies that the task should end no
later than the specified date. This information is not used for
scheduling, but only for checking the schedule afterwards. Since the
task will end later than the specified date, commenting out the line
would trigger a warning.

Now the project has been completely specified. Stopping here would
result in a valid TaskJuggler file that could be processed and
scheduled. But no reports would be generated to visualize the results.

=== Visualizing the Project ===

To see and share the project data you reports can be generated. You
can generate any number of reports and you can select from a variety
of report types and output formats. To have a report generated after
the project scheduling has been completed, you need include a report
definition into the project description. Report definitions are
properties that are very similar to the task and resource properties
that you are already familiar with. Just like these, report
definitions can be nested to take advantage of the attribute
inheritance mechanism. Every report definition starts with the type
of the report. Each type of report has a particular focus. A
[[taskreport]] lists the project data in the form of a task list.
A [[resourcereport]] does the same in form of a resource list. For a
more generic report, you can use the [[textreport]].

A ''''textreport'''' does not directly present the data in form of a
task or resource list. It just consists of text building blocks that
are described by [[Rich_Text_Attributes|Rich Text]]. There can be a
building block at the top and bottom, as well as three columns in
the center. The column are called ''''left'''', ''''center'''' and
''''right''''.

For our first report, we'll just use the center column for now. Like
every property, you need to specify a name. This name will be the
base name of the generated report file. Depending on the output
format, the proper suffix is appended. For this report, we only chose
to generate a web page in HTML format. There is no default format
defined for reports. If the [[formats]] attribute is not specified,
no output file will be generated for the report specification.

This may seem odd at first glance since TaskJuggler syntax always
tries to use the most compact and readable syntax for the common
case. As you will see in a minute, reports may be composed of several
report specifications. One report specification can include the
output of another report specification as well. In this case, the
included report does not need to generate it's own file. The output
will be included within the output of another report specification.
In case of such composed reports, the output format specification of
the top-level format will be used for all included reports as well.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview_report1"]>

For the main report, we choose the file name ''''Overview'''' and the
format ''''html''''. So, the generated file will be called
''''Overview.html''''.

As we've mentioned before, the sections of a ''''textreport'''' are
defined in Rich Text format. Here we use a so called block generator
to include the HTML output of another report definition. The
''''report'''' block generator allows us to compose reports by
combining their output into a single report. You must provide the
''''id'''' parameter to specify which report definition you would
like to use. In this case, it is a report definition with the ID
''''overview''''. Note that generator parameters need to be enclosed
in single or double quotes. We are essentially marking a string
within a string. This can only work out, if we don't use the same
parameter for both. Let's define this report first.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview1"]>

Instead of another [[textreport]] definition we are now using a
[[taskreport]]. A task report contains a list of tasks in a table
structure. By default, it contains all tasks of the project. As we
will see later on, we can use filter expressions to limit the content
to a well defined subset of tasks. The table contains a line for each
task and comes by default with a few columns like the name of the
task, and the start and end dates. For this project overview report,
we like to have also the effort for each task, the duration, the
effort, the cost and revenue numbers included. To top it off, we also
include a column with a Gantt chart.

By including the cost and revenue column, we are able to do a simple
profit and loss analysis on the project. This P&L is computed from
the accounts that we have provided above. For this to work, we need
to tell TaskJuggler which accounts are cost accounts and which are
revenue accounts. We have already conveniently grouped the accounts
and the [[balance]] attribute specifies which accounts are used for
the P&L in this report.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview2"]>

The columns of the report can be customized. You can overwrite the
default title or the cell content. See [[columns]] for a full list of
available attributes. For the chart column, we'd like to have a
tool tip that displays additional details when the mouse pointer is
placed over a task bar. Since we use this tool tip in several
reports, we have defined the ''''TaskTip'''' macro for it.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="tasktip"]>

The [[tooltip.column|tooltip]] attribute describes the content of the
tool tip. The first parameter is a logical expression that determines
when the tool tip is active. You can specify multiple tool tips. The
first matching one is being displayed. The condition is evaluated for
each report line. The ''''istask()'''' function only evaluates to true
for task lines. See [[functions]] for a complete list of functions
that can be used in [[logicalexpression|logical expressions]].

The content of the tool tip is a template that uses
[[Rich_Text_Attributes#Block_and_Inline_Generators|query
generators]] to include task attributes such as the start and end
date.

We have chosen to include the start and end date of each task in the
report. By default, TaskJuggler lists dates as day, month and year.
We like the format to be similar to the format that the project
syntax uses, but also like to include the weekday. To change the date
format, the [[timeformat]] attribute can be used.

The project will last a few weeks. The most convenient unit to list
efforts in is man or resource days. The [[loadunit]] attribute tells
TaskJuggler to list the load of each task or resource in man days.
Since this will just be a number without a unit, it is advisable to
include a small hint for the reader that these values are indeed man
or resource days. The caption of the table is a convenient place to
put this information by using the [[caption]] attribute.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview3"]>

The ''''taskreport'''' can contain more than just the table. It is
not as flexible as the ''''textreport'''', but still has support for
a header and footer. Let's look at the header first. We not only
like to put a headline here, but several paragraphs of text. The
[[header]] attribute is a [[Rich_Text_Attributes|Rich Text]]
attribute just like [[center]]. We could enclose it in single or
double quotes again. But for Strings that span multiple lines and
potentially include single or double quotes as well, scissor-marks or
cut-here-marks are recommended. These marks look like a pair of
scissors that cut along a dashed line. Use
''''<nowiki>-8<-</nowiki>'''' to begin a string and ''''->8-'''' to
terminate it. The opening cut mark must be immediately followed by a
line break. The indentation of the following line defines the
indentation that will be ignored for all lines of the string. The
following lines must have at least the same indentation. The
indentation that exceeds the indentation of the first line will be
kept in the resulting string. With this feature, you can define
multi-line Rich Text strings without disturbing the indentation
structure of your project file.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview4"]>

Section headers are surrounded by ''''<nowiki>==</nowiki>''''. The
number of equal signs, define the section level. You need to start
with two equal characters for the first level. Text that is surrounded
by blank lines will create a paragraph. Bullet lists can be made by
starting a line with a ''''#'''' character. Remember that the
indentation of cut-mark strings will be ignored. Your ''''#''''
character must not be the first character in the line as long it is
only preceded by the exact same number of blanks as the first line of
the cut-mark string.

If you want to reference other reports from this report, you can
include the file name of this report by ''''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''''
and ''''<nowiki>]]</nowiki>''''.  Don't include the extension of the
file name, it will be automatically appended. The actual
representation of the reference depends on the chosen output format.
For HTML output, the reference is a click-able link to the referenced
report file.

For the [[footer]] we can proceed accordingly. We just add a few more
paragraphs of text the describe certain aspects of the project. By
putting it all together, we end up with the following report
definition.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview"]>

The generated report can be found
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Overview.html
here]. It servers as an entry page for the other reports. While it
already contains some references, a navigator bar would be handy as
well. Fortunately, there is a block generator called 'navigator' to
take care of this. But before we can include the navigator in the
report, we need to define it first.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="navigator"]>

[[hidereport]] is a filter attribute. The logical expression
determines which reports will be included in the navigator bar. A
logical expression of 0 means hide no reports, so all are included.

The best place to put a navigator bar in the report is right at the
top. We use two horizontal lines to separate the navigator from the
main headline and the rest of the report.
''''<nowiki>----</nowiki>'''' at the begin of the line create such a
horizontal separation line.

<[example file="tutorial" tag="overview_report2"]>
