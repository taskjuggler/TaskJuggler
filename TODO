= Todo list for TaskJuggler III

This is a possibly still incomplete list of things that still could
or should be done for TaskJuggler III.

* Fix syntactical problem with list values inherited from parent
  scenarios. There is no way to purge them.

== Missing features for 2.x compatibility

* Add missing functions for logical expressions.

* Missing reports (calendar, status, csv)

* Column attributes like hidecelltext,
  hidecellurl, subtitle, subtitleurl, titleurl

* Critical path detection after scheduling.

* Many dynamic report columns are still missing.

* Fix handling of non-hour-aligned timezones.

* More unit tests for core classes.

* Lots more test cases for the test suite.

== New features (probably after first stable release)

* Hammock tasks

* Delta reports that show only the differences between 2 arbitrary
  scenarios.

* SVG reports

* Pert charts

= Discontinued 2.x features

TaskJuggler III should be mostly compatible with 2.x. Existing
projects should be usable with TaskJuggler III with no to minimal
effort. Nevertheless we will use the transition to TaskJuggler III as
an opportunity to drop some things that have been badly designed or
are of too little use to justify the porting efforts.

There is currently no plan to port the TaskJuggler 2.x GUI due to
lack of time/resources. Help in this area will be greatly appretiated.

* XML file reading.
